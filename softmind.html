    <h1>SoftMind</h1>
    <p>
      A mental health experience designed to reduce anxiety by
      removing pressure, metrics, and decision overload.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Most mental health apps overwhelm users with dashboards,
      streaks, and excessive tracking. During anxiety,
      users need safety — not performance.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>User</h2>
    <p>
      Adam, 30 — office employee.  
      Experiences anxiety spikes and avoids complex interfaces.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Design Approach</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>One emotional state per screen</li>
      <li>No numbers, no dashboards</li>
      <li>Supportive microcopy</li>
      <li>Slow, predictable flows</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>User Flow</h2>
    <p>
      Open app → emotional check-in → guided breathing →
      reassurance → exit without fatigue
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Insight</h2>
    <p>
      UX can act as emotional regulation.
      When users feel safe, engagement becomes natural.
